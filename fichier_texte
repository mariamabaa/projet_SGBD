I need to create a document for a horribly complicated schema in XML, from C,
using libxml2.  Since the document has a schema I am bootstrapping myself by
creating an empty document, testing it, and then adding elements etc as needed
until it validates.  At that point, hopefully, I will (1) have a good starting
point and (2) understand libxml2 much more than I do right now.

But anyway, just to get there has taken fair amount of effort, so here's the
code, in case it will help anyone else (some parts removed to protect the
innocent - mainly logging).  Also, logging and handling of failures is
incomplete.

PS This is on CentOS 5.4, although I had to install libxml from
https://github.com/projecthydra/libxml2 to handle my particular schema.
